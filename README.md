# Battle

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine
```
$ git clone https://github.com/meruyert123/Battle.git
```
2. Install Xcode

You need to install the latest version of Xcode. It can be downloaded for free from [Apple’s website](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
3. Open .xcodeproj file in Xcode

To run the Xcode project, you can click the “Play” (Run) button on the top left corner, or you can simply press Command + R. Make sure you select which specific device or simulator you want the app to run on since the Generic iOS Device won’t work. Once Xcode project builds, your app should be up and running in the simulator like in the image below:
